ABOUT THE PROJECT:
The project involved a comparative analysis of different cities in India based on various cuisine styles, such as Bakery, Chinese, Italian, North Indian, South Indian, etc, delivery time between interstate cities like Mumbai and Pune, as well as the mode of payment used for the delivery of the food items. 
The analysis was made using pivot tables and slicers, followed by different graphs like column charts, pie chart, bar chart and sunburst chart.
INITIAL THOUGHTS
When I first approached the dataset, my primary goal was to understand how food ordering patterns vary across cities and cuisines. Although the comparisons between two different cities based on cuisine and payment method could be made easily using conventional charts, I was particularly interested in exploring whether consumer preferences could be visually represented in a way that shows both hierarchy and distribution, for cities, cuisine type and count of items altogether and therefore, I took a step forward to explore unconventional chart like a sunburst chart for the project.
MY APPROACH TOWARDS THE PROJECT:
First, to begin with, I created comparative charts between Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Delhi, Chennai and Hyderabad based on the count of items for each cuisine type using bar and column charts. Next, since I had already created similar comparative charts for the six cities, I tried something different for Mumbai and Pune, since they are interstate cities, and therefore, I created a comparative pie chart based on their average delivery timings to analyse how the delivery time differs between these two populated cities despite being in the same state. I also created a pivot chart for different payment methods used from the pivot table I created, and included slicers for the city and the cuisine style for easy comparison. Last but not least, for the representation of consumer patterns in all the cities based on their cuisine and the number of items, I showcased a sunburst chart, which helped me understand the pattern using hierarchical visualisations.
CHALLENGES FACED:
The major challenge in this project was about creating the hierarchical data for all the cities and cuisine types in the same chart. With multiple cities and cuisines, the visualization initially became cluttered and difficult to interpret. Another issue was choosing an appropriate colour scheme as similar colours made it hard to distinguish categories, while too many contrasting colours distracted from the insight. Additionally, I struggled with deciding which data labels to display, as showing all values reduced readability.
To overcome these challenges, I grouped smaller categories, limited the number of labels, and used consistent colour families for each city. These adjustments significantly improved clarity without losing important information.
KEY INSIGHTS:
In the two cities comparisons, the difference was only in certain cuisine types like healthy, fast food and Mexican for most of the cities where Bengaluru and Delhi had the highest consumption rates for healthy as well as fast food compared to Ahmedabad and Chennai. They also differed in the case of Mexican foods where Chennai and Delhi had a whopping difference of 10 while Ahmedabad and Bengaluru had only a difference of 5 which showcased the difference in consumer patterns of different cities. On the other hand, Kolkata and Hyderabad posed a key difference between consumption of Italian and north and south Indian foods in both the cities unlike that of other cities where these cuisines were mostly on a similar level. In the comparison, Hyderabad emerged as the maximum consumer of both the cuisines compared to Kolkata, which had a greater demand for Italian food. All these analyses show how consumer choice and preference for different cuisines differ from city to city.
Next, from the comparison between Pune and Mumbai we find interstate cities don’t differ much in their delivery although they might differ from state to state based on the living conditions there.
All the cities however, differ on an extreme basis when it comes to payment methods and cuisine although the preference of cash still persists in most of the cities compared to their counter parts like UPI, Debit or Credit which shows that even after digitalisation people are still more comfortable with older payment methods compared to the newer ones.
The final visualization of sunburst chart revealed  a summary of the patterns in consumer behaviour. Certain cities showed strong preferences for specific cuisines, while others displayed a more diverse ordering pattern. The item count distribution also highlighted that some cuisines tend to be ordered in larger quantities, suggesting differences in consumption habits. The sunburst chart allowed me to observe these patterns simultaneously, something which was not visible in one go with individual charts.
TAKEAWAY FROM THE PROJECT:
Through this analysis, I learned that effective data visualization is as much about decision making as it is about technical execution. Choosing the right chart type, managing visual complexity, and guiding the viewer’s attention are extremely crucial for making a meaningful data story and data driven decisions.
