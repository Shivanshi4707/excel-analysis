ABOUT THE PROJECT:
The project involved a comparative analysis of different cities in India based on various cuisine styles, such as Bakery, Chinese, Italian, North Indian, South Indian, etc, delivery time between interstate cities like Mumbai and Pune, as well as the mode of payment used for the delivery of the food items. 
The analysis was made using pivot tables and slicers, followed by different graphs like column charts, pie chart, bar chart and sunburst chart.
INITIAL THOUGHTS
When I first approached the dataset, my primary goal was to understand how food ordering patterns vary across cities and cuisines. Although the comparisons between two different cities based on cuisine and payment method could be made easily using conventional charts, I was particularly interested in exploring whether consumer preferences could be visually represented in a way that shows both hierarchy and distribution, for cities, cuisine type and count of items altogether and therefore, I took a step forward to explore unconventional chart like a sunburst chart for the project.

MY APPROACH TOWARDS THE PROJECT:
First, to begin with, I created comparative charts between Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Delhi, Chennai and Hyderabad based on the count of items for each cuisine type using bar and column charts. Next, since I had already created similar comparative charts for the six cities, I tried something different for Mumbai and Pune, since they are interstate cities, and therefore, I created a comparative pie chart based on their average delivery timings to analyse how the delivery time differs between these two populated cities despite being in the same state. I also created a pivot chart for different payment methods used from the pivot table I created, and included slicers for the city and the cuisine style for easy comparison. Last but not least, for the representation of consumer patterns in all the cities based on their cuisine and the number of items, I showcased a sunburst chart, which helped me understand the pattern using hierarchical visualisations.

CHALLENGES FACED:
The major challenge in this project was about creating the hierarchical data for all the cities and cuisine types in the same chart. With multiple cities and cuisines, the visualization initially became cluttered and difficult to interpret. Another issue was choosing an appropriate colour scheme as similar colours made it hard to distinguish categories, while too many contrasting colours distracted from the insight. Additionally, I struggled with deciding which data labels to display, as showing all values reduced readability.
To overcome these challenges, I grouped smaller categories, limited the number of labels, and used consistent colour families for each city. These adjustments significantly improved clarity without losing important information.

KEY INSIGHTS:
.Food consumption patterns vary noticeably across cities, reflecting regional preferences.
.Bengaluru and Delhi showed higher consumption for certain cuisines like healthy and fast food compared to cities such as Ahmedabad and Chennai.
.Kolkata and Hyderabad displayed contrasting patterns in Italian and North/South Indian cuisine consumption.
.The comparison between Mumbai and Pune revealed minimal differences in delivery time despite being major interstate cities.
.Payment preferences varied widely across cities, with cash remaining dominant in many cases despite the availability of digital payment methods.
.The sunburst chart provided a consolidated view of consumer behaviour, highlighting both concentrated and diverse cuisine preferences across cities.

TAKEAWAY FROM THE PROJECT:
Through this analysis, I learned that effective data visualization is as much about decision making as it is about technical execution. Choosing the right chart type, managing visual complexity, and guiding the viewer’s attention are extremely crucial for making a meaningful data story and data driven decisions.
